Define the input parameters for the power turbine system, such as the temperature and pressure of the inlet gas, the rotational speed of the turbine, and the blade geometry.</br>
        Run the simulation and analyze the output data,</br> such as the power output of the turbine,</br> the turbine efficiency,</br> and the temperature and pressure of the outlet gas.</br>
Modify the input parameters </br> re-run the simulation to observe how changes in the system affect its performance.
Save the results of the simulation and use them to optimize the design and operation of the power turbine system.</p>
